3-M1-AGI-V0.1.0 draws inspiration from groundbreaking AI systems like AlphaGo/AlphaZero and AlphaDev. It envisions a sorting algorithm that not only overcomes memory limitations but also continually self-optimizes to meet real-world demands, hinting at the capabilities of a potential AGI.

The Challenge

Current sorting algorithms often struggle when handling very large datasets, such as those containing image-like data, due to excessive memory requirements.  S3-M1-AGI-V0.1.0 will initially use a base of Compressed Radix Sort,  leveraging simplified texture compression principles and optimized radix sorting.

Path Towards Self-Improvement

Metric-Driven Evolution: The algorithm will monitor speed, memory usage, and the degree of data loss across datasets and compression variations.
Reinforcement Learning Framework: S3-M1-AGI-V0.1.0 will dynamically adjust its own compression, sorting parameters, and integration logic, treating these as actions in a learning framework seeking continuous optimization.
Code Generation Exploration: Inspired by AlphaCode, we'll investigate whether the algorithm can self-generate and refine its compression/decompression code for hyper-specialized efficiency.
